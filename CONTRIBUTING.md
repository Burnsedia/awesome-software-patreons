# Contribution Guidelines

Follow the generic guidelines for contributions to awesome lists described [here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/contributing.md).

When adding a new Patreon account, please make sure that:

* If you want to add your own patreon, don't worry, go ahead.
* The project or the developer is still active (at least and update in the last year).
* For individuals claiming major contribution to a well known project, verify that they are actually who they say they are (i.e. check their twitter account, verify their contribution history, etc...).
* Add the project to the right category(for people doing generic opensource work on multiple project use the specific category) or create a new one if you feel it's needed. 
* New links are always added at the end of their category.

Thank you for contributing to this list.
