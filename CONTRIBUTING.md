# Contribution Guidelines

Follow the generic guidelines for contributions to awesome lists described [here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/contributing.md).

When adding a new Patreon account, please make sure that:

**Elegibility**
* The project or the individual developer is still active (at least a consistent update in the last three months).
* For individuals claiming major contributions to a well known project, verify that they are actually who they say they are (i.e. check that this is in fact their patreon, check their twitter account, verify their contribution history, etc...).
* If you want to add your own patreon, don't worry, go ahead, this list has been built for you.

**Right Category**
* Add the project to the right category (for people doing generic opensource work on multiple projects use the specific category) or create a new one if you feel it's needed. 
* If a project contains custom hardware or the individual develops its own hardware in addition to software, add it to the hardware category.
* The list of links follows the alphabetical order, insert your new item in the right position.

**Funding Types**
* Alternatives to Patreon, that provide similar *recurring payment schemes*, are accepted (Opencollective, Liberapay, Flattr, Podia, Drip, etc...).
* Paypal donation links are sometimes tolerated for bigger projects.


Thank you for contributing to this list.
